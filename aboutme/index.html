    <p>Hello everyone, I'm excited to be part of this class and to get to know all of you. Here is a little bit about me. I’m from El Salvador, currently living in Utah. I've been in the United States for the last 10 years. I love this place; the people and the views are great. I enjoy myself most of the time being outdoors, looking for hikes, and lakes, and walking around town.</p>
       <p> I grew up Catholic, once I moved here, I had the opportunity to meet with missionaries and eventually have the privilege to get baptized along with my brother. Later, I decided to go out and serve others by serving a full-time mission in Nampa, Idaho.</p> 
        <p>Now I am a dental technician. I am obsessed with big smiles and enjoy my job. My dream job was to become a dentist. Over the past few months, things have changed a bit, and now I have decided to explore potential career fields that I have always been interested in. I’m so excited to learn along with all of you.  I don’t have doubts this is going to be a great opportunity and blessing for all of us.</p>
